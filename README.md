<h1>Introduction</h1>
My name is <i>Seagata Barus</i>. <br>
I'm 22 years old. <br>
My house is in the southeastern section of Kendari, where all the uncivilized people are, and I am not married. <br>
I study at Telkom University Bandung, and I always make sure to submit my assignment before the Deadline. <br>
I don't smoke, but I'm addicted to Gacha game. <br>
I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get at least 6.5 hours of sleep, no matter what. <br>
After doing my Limbus Company, FGO JP, Honkai Star Rail, and Wuthering Waves dailies, I pray to the GOD then sleep, <br>
I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. <br>
Just like a dreadful man, I wake up with a sorrow and derision in the morning.<br>
I was told that I should get a maiden. <br>
<br>
I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a quiet life. <br>
I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, and I try to cause any trouble. <br>
That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. <br>
Although, if you want to talk to me just chat with me via Telegram <i>@seagata.</i> <br>
