<h1>Introduction</h1>
My name is <i>Seagata Barus</i>. <br>
I'm 19 years old. <br>
My house is in the southern section of Kendari, where all the uncivilized ppl are, and I am not married. <br>
I study in Telkom University Bandung, and I always makes sure to submit my assignment before the Deadline. <br>
I don't smoke, but I'm addicted to Coffee. <br>
I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get at least 6 hours of sleep, no matter what. <br>
After doing my Genshin daily commission and check on my oil and ship in azur lane then praying before bed, <br>
I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. <br>
Just like a dread man, I wake up with dead inside feeling in the morning.<br>
I was told that I rarely touching grass these days. <br>
<br>
I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a quiet life. <br>
I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, and trying to didnt get salted by other people. <br>
That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. <br>
